## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server) must be accessible from both Alfresco and client browsers, and must be capable of sending POST requests to Alfresco.

You can choose between two deployment options:

### 🖥️ Self-hosted version

- **Community Edition** (free): [Docker installation guide](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) or [manual installation](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx)
- **Enterprise Edition**: [Installation guide](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/enterprise)

Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

### ☁️ ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud

If you prefer not to host or maintain your own server, try ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud — no download or setup required. [Get started here](https://www.onlyoffice.com/docs-registration)

## Installing ONLYOFFICE module package for Alfresco 📥

To start using ONLYOFFICE Document Server with Alfresco, the following steps must be performed for Ubuntu 14.04:

The latest compiled package files are available [here](https://github.com/onlyoffice/onlyoffice-alfresco/releases).

1. Upload the compiled **\*.amp** packages to directories accordingly for your Alfresco installation:
    * from `onlyoffice-alfresco/repo/target/` to the `/usr/local/tomcat/amps/` for Alfresco repository,
    * from `onlyoffice-alfresco/share/target/` to `/usr/local/tomcat/amps_share/` for Share.

2. Use the Module Management Tool (MMT) to install modules, run this commands:

    Alfresco:
    ```
    java -jar /usr/local/tomcat/alfresco-mmt/alfresco-mmt.jar install /usr/local/tomcat/amps/onlyoffice-integration-repo.amp /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/alfresco
    ```

    Share:
    ```
    java -jar /usr/local/tomcat/alfresco-mmt/alfresco-mmt.jar install /usr/local/tomcat/amps_share/onlyoffice-integration-share.amp /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/share
    ```

    > More details about using MMT can be found here `https://docs.alfresco.com/content-services/latest/install/zip/amp/`

3. Make sure that Document Server will be able to POST to Alfresco.

    You may need to change these lines in `alfresco-global.properties` or you can set it using [configuration page](#configuration).

    ```
    alfresco.host=<hostname>
    alfresco.port=443
    alfresco.protocol=https

    share.host=<hostname>
    share.port=443
    share.protocol=https
    ```

    > Probably located here `/usr/local/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco-global.properties`

3. Restart Alfresco:
    ```bash
    sudo ./alfresco.sh stop
    sudo ./alfresco.sh start
    ```
The module can be checked in administrator tools at `share/page/console/admin-console/module-package` in Alfresco.

## Configuration

Module configuration can be found inside `Alfresco Administration Console` or by simply navigating to `http://<alfrescohost>/alfresco/s/onlyoffice/onlyoffice-config`

> You can also add `onlyoffice.url` in `alfresco-global.properties`. Configuration made via settings page will override `alfresco-global.properties`.

Configuration settings include JWT, enabled by default to protect the editors from unauthorized access. If setting a custom **Secret key**, ensure it matches the one in the ONLYOFFICE Docs [config file](https://api.onlyoffice.com/docs/docs-api/additional-api/signature/) for proper validation.

> You can set the secret key by adding *onlyoffice.security.key* to `alfresco-global.properties`.

## Compiling ONLYOFFICE module package for Alfresco

If you plan to compile the ONLYOFFICE module package for Alfresco yourself (e.g. edit the source code and compile it afterwards), follow these steps. 

1. The latest stable Oracle Java version is necessary for the successful build. If you do not have it installed, use the following commands to install Oracle Java 8:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
    ```

2. Install latest Maven:
Installation process is described [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

3. Download the ONLYOFFICE module package for Alfresco source code:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onlyoffice/onlyoffice-alfresco.git
    ```

4. Get a submodule:
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

5. Compile packages in the `repo` and `share` directories:
    ```bash
    cd onlyoffice-alfresco/
    mvn clean install
    ```

Another way to build ONLYOFFICE module package for Alfresco is using docker-compose file.

Use this command from project directory:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## How it works 🛠️

The ONLYOFFICE integration follows the API documented [here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/docs/docs-api/get-started/basic-concepts/):

* User navigates to a document within Alfresco Share and selects the `Edit in ONLYOFFICE` action.
* Alfresco Share makes a request to the repo end (URL of the form: `/parashift/onlyoffice/prepare?nodeRef={nodeRef}`).
* Alfresco Repo end prepares a JSON object for the Share with the following properties:
  * **url**: the URL that ONLYOFFICE Document Server uses to download the document (includes the `alf_ticket` of the current user),
  * **callbackUrl**: the URL that ONLYOFFICE Document Server informs about status of the document editing;
  * **onlyofficeUrl**: the URL that the client needs to reply to ONLYOFFICE Document Server (provided by the onlyoffice.url property);
  * **key**: the UUID+Modified Timestamp to instruct ONLYOFFICE Document Server whether to download the document again or not;
  * **title**: the document Title (name).
* Alfresco Share takes this object and constructs a page from a freemarker template, filling in all of those values so that the client browser can load up the editor.
* The client browser makes a request for the javascript library from ONLYOFFICE Document Server and sends ONLYOFFICE Document Server the docEditor configuration with the above properties.
* Then ONLYOFFICE Document Server downloads the document from Alfresco and the user begins editing.
* ONLYOFFICE Document Server sends a POST request to the `callback` URL to inform Alfresco that a user is editing the document.
* Alfresco locks the document, but still allows other users with write access the ability to collaborate in real time with ONLYOFFICE Document Server by leaving the Action present.
* When all users and client browsers are done with editing, they close the editing window.
* After 10 seconds of inactivity, ONLYOFFICE Document Server sends a POST to the `callback` URL letting Alfresco know that the clients have finished editing the document and closed it.
* Alfresco downloads the new version of the document, replacing the old one.

## ONLYOFFICE Docs editions

ONLYOFFICE offers different versions of its online document editors that can be deployed on your own servers.
